pygmin Turorial
===============

pygmin is a package for global optimization and energy landscape analysis.
For global optimization the preferred method is to use basinhopping.
basinhopping a stochastic search algorithm whos structure is very similar to
the Monte Carlo algorithm but does a local minimization (or quench) after every
step and uses the quenched energy in the accept/reject criterion.

By energy landscape analysis we generally mean finding geometrical transition
states between known minima.  If we build up a network of minima and transition
states we can have a very good picture of the thermodynamic and even dynamic
properties of the system.  A general work cycle often looks like

1. use :ref:`Basinhopping <global_optimization>` to find the global minimum and other important minima

2. use :ref:`DoubleEndedConnect <landscape_description>` to find the connected pathways of minima and
   transition states between these known minima

3. post anysis might include plotting the :ref:`disconnectivity graph <disconnectivity_graph>`



Creating Your Potential
-----------------------
pygmin has a number of potentials built in, including the Lennard-Jones potential which
is used for most of our examples.  It also has an interface to the GMIN program with
which you can access any myriad of GMIN's built in potentials.
We also plan to build interfaces to some of the standard molecular dynamics packages
like gromacs and OpenMM.  

The flexibility of pygmin alows it to be easily used with just about any scalar
function.  Probably the biggest limitation is that, because we use a lot of
gradient based local minimization you may experience problems if your potential
is discontinuous.

simple 1D potential
+++++++++++++++++++
Lets create an artificial potential from the sum of a parabola and a cosine
term::

  from pygmin.potentials import BasePotential
  import numpy as np
  class My1DPot(BasePotential):
      def getEnergy(x):
          return np.cos(14.5 * x[0] - 0.3) + (x[0] + 0.2) * x[0]

The above definition of member function getEnergy() is all that is required to
use the global optimization features of pygmin.  It is derived from BasePotential, which will
calculate gradient numerically.  However, Defining an analytical gradient will
make things run a lot faster::

  from pygmin.potentials import BasePotential
  import numpy as np
  class My1DPot(BasePotential):
      """1d potential"""
      def getEnergy(self, x):
          return np.cos(14.5 * x[0] - 0.3) + (x[0] + 0.2) * x[0]

      def getEnergyGradient(self, x):
          E = self.getEnergy(x)
          grad = np.array([-14.5 * np.sin(14.5 * x[0] - 0.3) + 2. * x[0] + 0.2])
          return E, grad


From this point you can jump in and use BasinHopping to find the global minimum.
The best way to do this is to use the convience wrapper, the :ref:`system class <system_class>`.
As a first start, all we must do is tell the system class what our potential is ::

  from pygmin.systems import BaseSystem
  class My1DSystem(BaseSystem):
      def get_potential(self):
          return My1DPot()

The following code will use the system class to initialize a basinhopping class
and run basinhopping for 100 steps.  We use an :ref:`sqlite database
<database>` to store the minima found::

    sys = My1DSystem()
    database = sys.create_database()
    x0 = np.array([1.])
    bh = sys.get_basinhopping(database=database, coords=x0)
    bh.run(100)
    print "found", len(database.minima()), "minima"
    min0 = database.minima()[0]
    print "lowest minimum found at", min0.coords, "with energy", min0.energy


atomic pair potential
+++++++++++++++++++++
We now look at a more involved system.
Lets create a system of atoms interacting via a pair potential similar to
the Lennard-Jones potential.  See pygmin/examples/new_potential/ for the code
related to this example::

  from pygmin.potentials import BasePotential
  class MyPot(BasePotential):
      """a Lennard Jones potential with altered exponents
      
      E(r) = r**-24 - r**-12
      """
      def __init__(self, natoms):
          self.natoms = natoms #number of atoms
      
      def getEnergy(self, coords):
          coords = np.reshape(coords, [natoms,3])
          E = 0.
          for i in range(natoms):
              for j in range(i):
                  r = np.sqrt(np.sum((coords[i,:] - coords[j,:])**2)) 
                  E += r**-24 - r**-12
          return E

      def getEnergyGradient(self, coords):
          coords = np.reshape(coords, [natoms,3])
          E = 0.
          grad = np.zeros(coords.shape)
          for i in range(natoms):
              for j in range(i):
                  dr = coords[i,:] - coords[j,:]
                  r = np.sqrt(np.sum(dr**2)) 
                  E += r**(-24) - r**(-12)
                  g = 24. * r**(-25) - 12. * r**(-13)
                  grad[i,:] += -g * dr/r
                  grad[j,:] += g * dr/r
          return E, grad.reshape(-1)


We have getEnergy and getEnergyGradient implemented, so the potential is
ready to use.

.. tip::
  Loops in python are very slow.  The above functions getEnergy() and
  getEnergyGradient() will run *a lot* faster in a compiled language.  Good
  choices might be cython or fortran (using f2py).  See the included potential
  pygmin.potentials.LJ for an example of how to do this.

We are now ready to define the system class. ::

    from pygmin.systems import BaseSystem
    class MySystem(BaseSystem):
        def __init__(self, natoms):
            super(MySystem, self).__init__()
            self.natoms = natoms
            self.params.database.accuracy =0.001

        def get_potential(self):
            return MyPot(self.natoms)

We can now run basinhopping in exactly the same way we did before::

    import numpy as np
    natoms = 8
    sys = MySystem(natoms)
    database = sys.create_database()
    x0 = np.random.uniform(-1,1,[natoms*3])
    bh = sys.get_basinhopping(database=database, coords=x0)
    bh.run(10)
    print "found", len(database.minima()), "minima"
    min0 = database.minima()[0]
    print "lowest minimum found has energy", min0.energy

.. note::

  The database saves all unique minima found, and determines uniqueness
  through an energy criterion.  If two minima have energies closer than
  database.accuracy then they are deemed to be the same minimum and one is
  discarded.  It might be a good idea to change this accuracy parameter to be
  more appropriate for your system. This is done in the above example where we
  set self.params.database.accuracy in __init__().  Note that this must be done
  after calling the base class __init__().

  Distinguishing minima by energy is generally good, but often not good enough.
  If you overload the function MySystem.get_compare_exact(), then the database
  will use that function in addition to the energy criterion to compare minima.
  See :ref:`structure alignment <structure_alignment>` for how to set that up.

.. note::

  One of the core routines of basinhopping is the takestep routine.  This is
  the routine which randomly moves the configuration through phase space.  The
  default is a random displacement of the coordinates where both the step size
  and the temperature are adaptively adjusted to give the best results.  For
  more complex systems there is often a better way to search.  Improving
  takestep is probably the most important thing you can do to improve the speed
  at which you find the global minimum.  See the :ref:`global optimization
  <global_optimization>` page for more information about how to use
  alternative, already implemented, takestep routines, and for more information
  about how to implement your own.  If you do choose to use a non-default
  takestep, you should overload MySystem.get_takestep() in order to use it with
  the system class.


finding transition state pathways
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We have, to this point, defined a potential, MyPotential, and a system class
MySystem with one function get_potential().  This was enough to run
basinhopping, but unfortunately is not enough to find transition states and
build up the connected network.  A few additional functions are required.

Many of the routines in DoubleEndedConnect need a distance metric which returns
how far apart are two structures.  This is know as mindist (or minpermdist) in
our lingo.  We use as our metric the root mean squared
deviation, so in the simplist case the distance is just::

  import numpy as np
  distance = np.linalg.norm(X1 - X2)

The simple case breaks down, however, when there are global symmetries of the
system.  Imagine the system is translationally invariant and `X2` is
exactly the same as `X1`, but just translated.  Then the root mean squared
deviation would give a large distance when the distance should be zero.
Thus the distance routine must take into account all the symmetries of a system.
Some common symmetries are

1. translational invariance
2. rotational invariance
3. reflection symmetry
4. permutational invariance

pygmin has all the utilities necessary for handling these cases, but they are,
by definition system dependent, so you must manually specify them for your
system.  These should be implemented in the system class by overloading 
MySystem.get_mindist().  See :ref:`Structure Alignment <structure_alignment>` for
how more detailed information and help choosing which routine to use.

Lets continue defining the system class for MyPotential.  Lets set
it up as a cluster of atoms floating in a vacuum.   Thus we have all three spatial
symmetries listed above.  Assuming the atoms are indistinguishable we also have
permutational symmetry.  The mindist function which deals with these 4 symmetries
is minPermDistStochastic() ::

  from pygmin.mindist import minPermDistStochastic
  class MySystem(BaseSystem):
    ...    
    def get_mindist(self):
        permlist = [range(self.natoms)]
        return MinDistWrapper(minPermDistStochastic, permlist=permlist)

We're not quite ready yet.  The routine which searches for transition states
uses a routine which walks uphill in the direction of the lowest eigenvector
(the eigenvector with the lowest eigenvalue) while walking downhill in all
other directions.  We find this lowest eigenvector by looking for the direction
with the largest negative curvature.  This search is a lot easier and less error
prone if the search space is reduced and made simpler by removing the trivial
zero eigenvectors.  These are directions in phase space which have zero 
eigenvalue and correspond to trivial global symmetries of the system, e.g.
translational and rotational symmetry, or frozen degrees of freedom.
In order to implement this, MySystem.get_orthogonalize_to_zero_eigenvectors()
must return a function which makes a given vector orthogonal to all trivial
zero eigenvectors.  See :ref:`transition state search <ts_refinement_description>`
for more information.  For our cluster system we have 3 zero eigenvectors
for translational symmetries and 3 zero eigenvectors for rotational symmetries.
The routine which takes care of this is called `orthogopt`
:: 

  from pygmin.transition_states import orthogopt
  class MySystem(BaseSystem):
      ...    
      def get_orthogonalize_to_zero_eigenvectors(self):
          return orthogopt


We are now ready to find transition state pathways between minima.
As a starting point we will use the database that we built up
from the basinhopping run above. We will connect all minima to the lowest
energy minimum. ::

    minima = database.minima()
    min1 = minima[0]
    for min2 in minima[1:]:
        connect = sys.get_double_ended_connect(min1, min2, database)
        connect.connect()


We now have a fully connected database (though the basinhopping run was quite
short, so we may not have found the global minimum yet).
As a final step, let's plot the connectivity in the database using a :ref:`disconnectivity
graph <disconnectivity_graph>` ::

    from pygmin.utils.disconnectivity_graph import DisconnectivityGraph
    from pygmin.landscape import Graph
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    #convert the database to a networkx graph
    graph = Graph(database).graph
    dg = DisconnectivityGraph(graph, nlevels=3, center_gmin=True)
    dg.calculate()
    dg.plot()
    plt.show()
